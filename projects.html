        <h2>Drone Delivery Application Prototype</h2>
        <img class="prototype" id="DroneZone" src="DeliveryApp.png" alt="Drone Zone Prototype">
        <p>This application was designed with the intention that food delivery would be 
            fast and efficient. Since technology has evolved, there are now options for 
            food delivery by technology. The application operates like any other food 
            delivery app, only you don't have to pay fees and taxes for drone delivery. 
            Users can order, track, and browse food from local restaurants with the comfort
            of staying in their home.

        <h3>Affinity Diagram: Digital Privacy</h3>
        <img class="diagram" id="affinitydiagram" src="AffinityDiagram.png" alt="Digital Privacy Affinity Diagram">
        <p>Affinity diagrams are often used to organize qualitiative data or observations from 
            contextual interviews or other methods to collect data. In this affinity diagram, our 
            group strategically organized data into meaningful groups to help create a solution 
            to creating a better sense of digital privacy that would be suitable to use for 
            multiple demographics of users.

        <img class="chikorita" id="pokemon" src="chikorita.png" alt="chikorita text art">
        <p>Making usable, easy to interact with interfaces in Python is an essential skill to 
            make successful products. In this project we aimed to make an interactive game intended 
            to easily guide the user throughout the game. Based on the popular franchise "Pokemon,"
            the player or user can choose multiple options which will affect their path in the game.
